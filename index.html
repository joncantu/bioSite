                  Welcome to a site about Gary Jones. Gary is originally from
                  southern California but has resided in Colorado for over 30
                  years. He has been retired since his early 50s and decided to
                  take up rock climbing and hiking. He is an avid hiker and has
                  been for decades. Gary is currently in his 70s and still hikes
                  and summits mountains as recently as this year (2025).

                  Gary has summited over 20 different 14ers (peaks of 14,000
                  feet or higher) - some of them multiple times - within the
                  state of Colorado as well as dozens of 13,000+ peaks. Gary has
                  also been on several hikes across the globe including Utah,
                  New Zealand, and Peru.

                  Among Gary's many accomplishments he has hiked Long's Peak
                  (multiple times), Quandary Peak (both from the East and West
                  approach), and Mt. Elbert. As well as many multiple peak
                  summit hikes such as Mt. Democrat, Mt. Cameron, and Mt.
                  Lincoln all in one day! There was also his hiking feat of
                  Gray's Peak and Torreys Peak in one day.

                  Some of Gary's other accomplishments are all of the lower
                  elevation hikes (still above 9,000 feet) which include Twin
                  Sisters, Storm Mountain, Sheep Mountain, and many others. Gary
                  enjoys both day hikes as well as multi-day backpacking trips.
                  He has done several backpacking trips in the Maroon Bells area
                  as well as in Rocky Mountain National Park. Gary enjoys
                  exploring new trails as well as revisiting favorite old
                  trails.
