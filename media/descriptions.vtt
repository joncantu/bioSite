The camera pauses on two women sitting and talking on a ledge below before they rise to climb up for better protection from the wind.

Panning back to the left, the camera passes a huge pine tree very close to the viewer.

The view opens to a flatter rocky area where Gary, wearing a yellow jacket and sunglasses, sits with a friend in a blue shirt and head wrap, both enjoying the windy mountain view.
