            <h2>Gary's Hobby</h2>
            <p>
              Gary's favorite hike, Sky Pond, is in Rocky Mountain National Park
              (RMNP). The Sky Pond trail leads you to the Lake of Glass. The Sky
              Pond Trail hike features some of the best views in Rocky Mountain
              National Park and many opportunities for viewing wildlife
              including elk and marmots. This hike takes you past some of the
              most beautiful alpine lakes in RMNP including Timberline Lake,
              Lake of Glass, and Sky Pond itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sky Pond hike is approximately 8.6 miles each direction and
              has an elevation gain of approximately 1,765 feet.
            </p>

              Another one of Gary's other favorite hikes is Twin Sisters - near
              RMNP across from Long's Peak (the most famous 14er in Colorado).

            <p>
              Twin Sisters Peak is a steep adventure that takes you to the top
              of the Continental Divide! The route is exposed and rocky in its
              uppermost stretch, and there are a few sections of scrambling to
              get to the summit. At the summit, you'll see amazing panoramic
              views, including one of the finest views of Longs Peak in the
              park.

            <p>
              The Twin Sisters trail is 7.4 miles each direction with a 2,483
              foot elevation gain.

              Gary enjoys many other hikes throughout Colorado and has
              accomplished quite a few notable hikes and summits over the years.

              One of the best resources for learning more about these hikes and
              any other hikes within Colorado is the
              <a href="https://alltrails.com" target="_blank">AllTrails</a>
              website. Start with a search for "Colorado 14ers" or "Rocky
              Mountain National Park". Chances are, Gary has been there.
