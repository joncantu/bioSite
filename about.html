                  Gary is currently in his 70s and still hikes
                  and summits mountains as recently as this year (2025).
                  During his hiking adventures he has discovered many
                  beautiful vistas and views of other mountain peaks from
                  across the way. He has also met many other hikers and made
                  many friends.

                  Gary has many hiking buddies who have shared in his
                  adventures. Gary manages about 3 hikes per week during the
                  warmer months in Colorado (typically April thru October) and
                  about 1 snowshoe hike per week during the colder months
                  (typically November thru March). So it helps to have friends
                  to share the experience with since he goes on so many hikes!

                  Throughout Gary's hiking adventures, he has had a few bumps
                  and bruises especially after he was diagnosed with a
                  non-cancerous tumor which is wrapped around one of his ear
                  canals but it would be far too risky to remove thus causing
                  issues with balance as well as his hearing. This has made
                  some rock climbing adventures more dangerous and has
                  resulted in a few injuries. Gary has had Talus go into his
                  forehead. He's had lacerations on his hands. A miriad of
                  bumps and bruises. But none of these have stopped him from
                  continuing to hike and explore both new and old trails.

                Gary is originally from southern California but has resided in
                Colorado (primarily Fort Collins) for over 30 years. He has
                been retired since his early 50s and decided to take up rock
                climbing and hiking. He is an avid hiker and has been for
                decades. Gary is currently in his 70s and still hikes and
